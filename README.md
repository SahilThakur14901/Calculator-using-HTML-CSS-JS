# Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS
A simple calculator created using vanilla JS, structured using HTML and styled using CSS.

Grid display has been employed to create a calculator such that the user gets a proper feel of the real thing. As of now, it only has basic functions so as to not make it very complicated during calculations.
Apart from the numbers 0-9, operations (+,-,*,รท) and the symbols '.' and '=', we have included an All_Clear and Delete button to perform the corresponding tasks. 

Gradient colour and the button hover effects have been added through CSS. The calculator has been made responsive using appropriate sizing units.

JavaScript has been used to provide functionality to the buttons and the output div. Using data- attributes instead of simple HTML classes was a new thing I learned through this project, as it helps to distinguish JS references from the CSS ones, and reduces the confusion while coding this application. Moreover, the display format for the numbers has been adjusted such that commas are included in case it is an integer using the 'toLocaleString' property. Object oriented programming was implemented through the use of classes in our javascript code.
